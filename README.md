**Web Network Booster ðŸš€**

Web Network Booster is a JavaScript-powered optimization tool designed to enhance web performance by:
âœ… Optimizing Fetch API for faster data retrieval.
âœ… Using WebRTC for low-latency peer-to-peer connections.
âœ… Implementing Service Workers for offline caching.
âœ… Lazy Loading images to improve page speed.
âœ… Modern UI with 3D Animation that visualizes the network boosting process.

**How It Works**

When you click the "Boost Network" button:

A 3D rotating cube appears, simulating the network enhancement process.

The script prioritizes critical data loading and caches important resources.

After a few seconds, the animation disappears, indicating optimized connectivity.
